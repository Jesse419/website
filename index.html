        <!--Hello There-->
      <h1 class="title"><em>Diary</em> of the <bold>Cats</bold></h1>
      <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> This website is a little about the cats in my life all with thier own dinstict personalities. I will be giving each Cat its own section, so you may see how different they all are! Most of the inner dialogue will usually be coming from one cats perspective</p>
  <section>
      <p><strong>This</strong> is about these <em>cats</em></p>
      <p>Hello Kitty-(ordinary cat extraordinaire. I didn’t choose the name a very happy 5 y/o child has named me (big Hello Kitty fan) I may or may not have some separation issues, but that’s neither here nor there.

 <p>Old man is Monty (called old cause he is over 20 years old, unknown age was a rescue has been at this house since The BIG One was young.)(his full name is Sir Monty of Gue, Lord of the Yard and leader of the Purple Paw Clan and Proud member of the Poofer Cheeks.) Has only been in MY house since last winter eating my food and my treats, the ungrateful cur.

 </p>
<p>
<p>
    The Humans, I know their names, but never bothered to remember which is called what, they don’t remember mine(calls me everything (kittens, kitty, fuzzy butt, brat-a-cat, scootchie bum and my least favourite lil shitten, to name but a few) but my name.
<p/>
<p>
The humans are as follows (Due to privacy reasons the human will not be pictured)
</p>

<p>The Tiny Humans- There’s three of them, lady and sir call them “The Kids”, they live in the big house and they know my name. They’re fun!! They play with me a lot when I am allowed outside (it isn’t often I’m allowed outside, still unknown why?)</p>

<p>The Lady- likes to think she owns me, but how wrong she is, I belong to the lil human, Katie, her daughter. (She only ranks #3 on the humans list (she puts a roof over my head and makes sure I am loved all day. In short, she does her job.)</p>
<p>
The BIG One – He is seriously my 2ND most favouritist human after Katie. I don’t know what it is about him but he can do absolutely no wrong.(fight me, I got murder mittens) He gives the best rubs and snuggles and uhh I just can’t explain, he’s almost perfect(I’m not allowed in the big house, unknown why, the kids are in there)(the reason he’s not Perfect)
</p>
<p>The other Big one, AKA Sir- he is the one around the most but we are still iffy about him, even if he is 4th or 5th favouritist human (he gives the treats)(says if the lady wasn’t around it would be a treat-for-all, suspect lies, but he gives the treats at the ordained times, if forgotten the old man reminds them. I am not needed for that lowly task anymore, thank the gods.)</p>
<p>The Mom – She lives in the big house too. Mom to the tiny human’s, she smells like the big one I think she is 3rd favourite human always with the BIG one or kids.</p>

<p>The Unfriendly Neighbours’</p>

<p>Yuno – Black and white Cat kind of scrawny, I think he’s a serial killer(can’t confirm yet, but the dead animals just keep piling up around the front door by him.(the BIG One says it’s rent. Honestly, no idea what rent is? and why do the little animals pay with their lives?) Suspect behaviour aside, I’m getting used to him, kind of, sort of, but not really

</p>
<p>The Evil Twins</p>
<p>Elvira- small, tiny, called cute, has the house humans wrapped around her paw.(suspected serial killer with Yuno> violent and fast, can’t keep her off the roof. Definitely doesn’t play well with others. Can chase her, but she’s fast can't catch her.
<img src="images/elviracat.jpg">
</p>
<p>
BubZ- small, not as tiny, called handsome kitty, (suspected with the others but he’s kind of nice) will kind of play with me. Really fun to chase around the yard, I get yelled at for doing this for some reason though.

          <h1>Day of Hello Kitty</h1>
          <p>Day Starts again, abruptly, The Old man is yelling again. I think the water bowl is empty again. I’m not going to look.  At least they got the good bottled water this time. I hate drinking out of the tap. (Do they not realize that the tap water is bad for my kidneys) Lady finally gets up after a bunch of groaning and yelling, no idea why she does this every morning. She’s finally off the bed means we get our first snicky-snack of the day.
          </p>
<p>The old man is yelling again, I don’t know what he is saying, never have, probably never will. OOH MY GOD the windows open just enough I can get out. I’m gone out, just like that, I heard the lady trying to get me before I got away. I am Free!! (The window was left open on purpose. We like to think she has more fun if she has “escaped”)
</p>
<p>
The outside world is kind of scary, especially with the neighbours in the big house. They haven’t been released outside this early in the morning, yet! Whilst I stalk this bird I going to crouch low, slowly creep straight towards, SLOWLY, SLOWLY.  Ok move straight towards it, I’m invisible in hunt mode, Straight towards it. Slowly, slo…… what the heck! I think it saw me! I am puzzled? As to how? I must ponder this, here and now! How did it see ME, HOW!? Oh well, time to go in time for treats again. I think today I’m going to play hard to get in. I’ll make it seem like I want in, but I won’t go in, I just sit at the bottom of the stairs. Wait I must rush in its snack time. Was a good snack, time for a nap.</p>
<p>The humans are gone!! I awoke, and they were gone! No goodbye! No See you later Kittens! Just GONE!!! I’ve looked and yelled out all my windows! I’ve called out for them, repeatedly! Where are they! OMG are they coming back? Is there water? Is there food? OMG I’m gonna starve I can’t open the wet food! I can’t reach the YUMMY LICK TREAT! Where does wet food grow? I’m going to STARVE!!!!</p>
<p>WHAT Really?! Really?! You, humans, were in the Big house! The Big house this WHOLE time really, I must make my displeasure known NOW!! Running and yelling at them at every window I can get to. All is good, now, I got a yummy lick treat.
</p>
<p>It’s nighttime, just got wet food. Monty was yelling like we weren’t going to get fed. I swear he acts like he was starved. Oh well, I don’t have to listen to him. I’m just going to lay in my basket and look out my window.  Yuno is out again tonight, one of the twins is with him, I can’t tell them apart in this light. They are chasing something in the yard again. I can’t quite make out what it is, but, I suspect it might be “rent” again. Poor little fuzzies just stop moving after they’re done playing with them. I don’t understand why they play with them.</p>
<p>In the morning, I heard “the Mom” scream about another dead body on the front porch. Saying rents been paid!</p>

          <h1>Day of Monty</h1>
          <p>
            Today we delve into the mind of Sir Monty, our vocal elder kitty. (he’s not spry, but he’s still a kitten in our eyes)</p>
  <p>I’ve awoken again with the water bowl empty! I must voice my displeasure by murring in the Lady’s face again.(he doesn’t meow, just makes this murrr noise lol) It does not work, she still sleeps. I shall go back to the water bowl again and bang my paw on it, until this situation is remedied. She wakes yelling again, but I care not. I yell back the water bowl is empty and I can see the bottom of the dry food. I slam my paw on the bowls again, remedy this situation at once.</p>
  <p>She is slow, but she gets it done finally. They have bought the High Ph water, I have recommended. (Him and Hello Kitty wouldn’t drink any other water till we fixed this) I better not have to remind her it’s snack time again. Ugh, I do have to remind her again. This work is so exhausting! I am taking a nap.</p>
  <p>It was a good nap I wonder how long that was. I feel enough time has passed, it is treat time again. I will let Lady and Sir know it is time. What do mean I’m early? How can I be early I slept a sufficient amount of time, it is treat time again, NOW!!! What do you mean? NO! Preposterous, I don’t know what 20 minutes even means! Fine then, I’ll just sulk over here until YOU say it’s time, I guess.</p>
  <p>Yes, it’s a licky treat time! Sir, but again, WHY Must she get them first? Sir, I don’t know what you mean “a gentleman lets a lady go first” It’s food, and I am Lord of this yard! Hmph, fine then, Sir, I’ll await my turn begrudgingly over in this area. My displeasure will be on full display up my face. Another nap commences.</p>
  <p>Awoken again by the other cat! Why must she try and sniff me whilst I sleep! I’ve told her time and time again, that this, is not acceptable cat behaviour, but she doesn’t understand. I have spoken with the other cats, they cannot seem to get her to understand either. I don’t think she speaks CAT, like, at all. She can meow, but it’s like the words just aren’t there. We’ve decided, we will only tolerate her, as long as the humans do. I have a feeling they won’t get rid of her though, they love her way too much to just abandoned her anywhere. We are stuck with her furever, we think
