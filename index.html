        <!--Hello There-->
      <h1 class="title">My Website</h1>
      <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> This website is a little about the cats in my life all with thier own dinstict personalities. I will be giving each Cat its own section, so you may see how different they all are! Most of the inner dialogue will usually be coming from one cats perspective</p>
      <p><strong>This</strong> is about these <em>cats</em></p>
      <p>Hello Kitty-(ordinary cat extraordinaire. I didn’t choose the name a very happy 5 y/o child has named me (big Hello Kitty fan) I may or may not have some separation issues, but that’s neither here nor there.
 <p>Old man is Monty (called old cause he is over 20 years old, unknown age was a rescue has been at this house since The BIG One was young.)(his full name is Sir Monty of Gue, Lord of the Yard and leader of the Purple Paw Clan and Proud member of the Poofer Cheeks.) Has only been in MY house since last winter eating my food and my treats, the ungrateful cur.</p>
<p>
<p>
    The Humans, I know their names, but never bothered to remember which is called what, they don’t remember mine(calls me everything<kittens, kitty, fuzzy butt, brat-a-cat, scootchie bum and my least favourite lil shitten, to name but a few> but my name.
The humans are as follows
</p>

<p>The Tiny Humans- There’s three of them, lady and sir call them “The Kids”, they live in the big house and they know my name. They’re fun!! They play with me a lot when I am allowed outside (it isn’t often I’m allowed outside, still unknown why?)</p>

<p>The Lady- likes to think she owns me, but how wrong she is, I belong to the lil human, Katie, her daughter. (She only ranks #3 on the humans list (she puts a roof over my head and makes sure I am loved all day. In short, she does her job.)</p>
<p>
The BIG One – He is seriously my 2ND most favouritist human after Katie. I don’t know what it is about him but he can do absolutely no wrong.(fight me, I got murder mittens)(). He gives the best rubs and snuggles and uhh I just can’t explain, he’s almost perfect(I’m not allowed in the big house, unknown why, the kids are in there)(the reason he’s not Perfect)
</p>
<p>The other Big one, AKA Sir- he is the one around the most but we are still iffy about him, even if he is 4th or 5th favouritist human (he gives the treats)(says if the lady wasn’t around it would be a treat-for-all, suspect lies, but he gives the treats at the ordained times, if forgotten the old man reminds them. I am not needed for that lowly task anymore, thank the gods.)</p>
<p>The Mom – She lives in the big house too. Mom to the tiny human’s, she smells like the big one I think she is 3rd favourite human always with the BIG one or kids.</p>

<p>The Unfriendly Neighbours’</p>

<p>Yuno – Black and white Cat kind of scrawny, I think he’s a serial killer(can’t confirm yet, but the dead animals just keep piling up around the front door by him.(the BIG One says it’s rent. Honestly, no idea what rent is? and why do the little animals pay with their lives?) Suspect behaviour aside, I’m getting used to him, kind of, sort of, but not really
</p>
<p>The Evil Twins</p>
<p>Elvira- small, tiny, called cute, has the house humans wrapped around her paw.(suspected serial killer with Yuno> violent and fast, can’t keep her off the roof. Definitely doesn’t play well with others. Can chase her, but she’s fast can't catch her.</p>
<p>
BubZ- small, not as tiny, called handsome kitty, <suspected with the others but he’s kind of nice> will kind of play with me. Really fun to chase around the yard, I get yelled at for doing this for some reason though.
</P/
